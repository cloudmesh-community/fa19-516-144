# Extremely Brief Discussion to Basic Security

## What does it mean to be secure? 

The better question is, whom are we secure from? Security in the modern sense  
in not based on an abstract concept of 'secure', it is more a measurement of  
confidence of security. But again, from whom and how?   

Let us take a simple example. 

*EXAMPLE PENDING*

Can we now be confident that the machine is secure?

## Understanding Security by Computation

This scenario may be helpful for understading your initial machine, but it only  
gives us confidence that the *particular* machine mentioned and studied is  
secured from that *particular* attack. What if the attacker had 100 machines?  
1,000 machines? The computational power of a nation-state? The computational  
power of some unnamed space faring civilization? This is the premise of 'security', 
understading in a computationally modeled sense the confidence that the  
algorithm holds.  

## The One Time Pad - Perfect Secrecy

## What is it

## Its Perfect! Right? 

Well, almost. The One Time Pad does allow your message to be perfectly secret,
but it requires the key to be size of the message you are encrypting *and* it
requires that you *never* reuse a key. Remeber its called the *one time* pad
for a reason. So we may have acheived our goal, but its not entirely practical. 

## Symmetric Encryption

### What is it? 


### Why use it? 

Now that we can reuse a key we can.
Now let us say we have Alice and Bob that are good friends. They want 


### Problem Solved?!? 

Well yes, we have securely communicated with another party but did you ever
ask. How did they get the keys in the first place? If Alice and Bob were
physically close to each other they could simply deliver the key to one
another. But we live in a digital world, how can digitally transfer my keys and
be confident that the intended person received it without it being revealed?

## Asymmetric Encryption

### Why use it? 

### What is it?

### Finally, Problem Solved!

Well, kind of.
