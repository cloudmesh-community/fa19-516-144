# Exercise 2: Carbon Footprint of Data Centers
Data Center: Condorcet Data center
Location: Paris, France
Year: 2009
Electricity Cost: 0.14
IT Load: 6400
Yearly Cost: 15,681,000
Yearly CO2 Footprint: 9307
Equivalence in cars: 2051

## Note: PUE of Condorcet Data center
Electricity Cost PUE is assumed to be 2.0. No resource with a specific PUE for the
Condorcet data center was discovered. 
Equinix (TelecityGroup) stated in reference three that the average annual PUE falls under
category three it is assumed their efficiency is average. Thus 2.0 was the selected
value.
This assumption doubles the total input power thus drastically increasing power cost in
comparison to a simple multiplication of electricity\_cost\*load\*hours\_in\_year
Yearly cost, CO2 footprint, and equivalence of cars are calculated by the "Data Center
Carbon Footprint Calculator"

# Exercise 4: Renewable Energy
Recyclers use the excess heat produced from the data center and reuses it in another
productive fashion. The Condorcet Data Center utilizes the excessive heat from the data
center to warm the arboretum throughout the year. This has the double positive
environmental impact of utilizing the excess energy and preserving trees. 
The Energy Systems Integration Facility utilizes the wasted energy to heat the water
and ventilation systems throughout the data center.
