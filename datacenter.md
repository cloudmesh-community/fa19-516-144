## Exercise 2: Carbon Footprint of Data Centers

```
Data Center: Condorcet Data center
Location: Paris, France
Year: 2009
Electricity Cost: 0.14
IT Load: 6400
Yearly Cost: 15,681,000
Yearly CO2 Footprint: 9307
Equivalence in cars: 2051
```

### Note: PUE of Condorcet Data center

Electricity Cost PUE is assumed to be 2.0. No resource with a specific PUE for the
Condorcet data center was discovered. 
Equinix (TelecityGroup) stated in reference three that the average annual PUE falls under
category three it is assumed their efficiency is average. Thus 2.0 was the selected
value.

This assumption doubles the total input power thus drastically increasing power cost in
comparison to a simple multiplication of `electricity_cost*load*hours_in_year`
Yearly cost, CO2 footprint, and equivalence of cars are calculated by the "Data Center
Carbon Footprint Calculator".

## Exercise 4: Renewable Energy Data Center

Recyclers use the excess heat produced from the data center and reuses it in another
productive fashion. The Condorcet Data Center utilizes the excessive heat from the data
center to warm the arboretum throughout the year. This has the double positive
environmental impact of utilizing the excess energy and preserving trees. 
The Energy Systems Integration Facility utilizes the wasted energy to heat the water
and ventilation systems throughout the data center.

## Exercise 5: Renewable Energy Country Efforts: Germany

Germany is a major contributor to global solar energy production. In 2017 Germany produced
36.1% of its energy from solar power. In 2016 Germany at one point met the energy demands
of its nation with renewables. Two years later it achieved another acomplishment of
meeting 100% of the energy demand with renewable technology. The extensive solar market
within Germany was supported by subsidies for installation of solar units. As reported by
Fortune the price of solar installation fell faster than anticipated which created a large
incentive to quickly build and install solar power within Germany.

## Exercise 8: Datacenter Outage Analysis: Delta Airlines

During three days August of 2016 Delta Airlines Atlanta data center experienced a power
outage in their Atlanta data center. This outage required Delta to ground all flights
for three days. 451 total flights were cancelled due to the outage. This outage cost 
Delta over $150,000,000 due to the loss of potential tickets which excludes the
number of travellers that were given cash and hotel compensation due to the cancelled
flights.
